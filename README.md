# Campus Booking Concept
My master and last school project for campus varberg. 

## About
The goal is to make a concept for campus booking system. 
At the moment it got its flaws and lacking featuers in some areas.
First and formost campus wants the ability to book study rooms, 
be able to list what kinde of tools are in the room. 
For example, tv, how many tables, pc's and so on.
They also want the ability to book the rooms, 
what times they are booked and free.
There should also be the ability to vote or let campus know what the students wants to have in there room.
