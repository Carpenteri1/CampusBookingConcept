# Campus Booking Client


## About
My master and last school project, will be a concept for an updated campus booking system. 
Campus wants to upgrade there current booking system with some more featuers.
This project simulates a job situation where I keep in contant with campus.
Iv hade meetings with the staff and gathered suggestions and feedback on what they want and how they want it. 
The meeting have been done via teams and mail do to the current corona pandemic. 
The course ends by showing the results of the project to campus.

#### This project is the Client, it can call the [API project](https://github.com/Carpenteri1/CampusBookingAPI) with

## Goal
Make an updated concept for there current booking system. 
first and foremost campus wants the ability to let students book study rooms.
They also want to let students and teachers see what tools they have in the class rooms and study rooms,
for example, tv, how many tables, pc's and so on.

Students should have the ability to give feedback on what tools they want to have for the specific rooms, general comments and suggestions or feedback. I might add some kinde of voting system also.
