# Campus Booking Concept
My master and last school project for campus varberg. 

## About
The goal is to make an updated concept for there current booking system. 
At the moment it got its flaws and lacking featuers in some areas.
first and foremost campus wants the ability to let students book study rooms.
They also want to let students and teachers see what tools they have in the class rooms and study rooms,
for example, tv, how many tables, pc's and so on.

Students should have the ability to give feedback on what tools they want to have for the specific rooms, general comments and suggestions or feedback.
I might add some kinde of voting system also.
